## My process

### Built with

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This site has helped me to familiriaze in the documentation of certain properties needed especially in JavaScript, CSS & HTML 
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Same as MDN Web Docs, the only difference is that sometimes I find w3schools to be more visualizing in CSS and HTML.
